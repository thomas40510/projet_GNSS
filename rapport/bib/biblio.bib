  abstract = {Over the past few years, the growth of GNSS applications has been staggering. And, this trend promises to continue in the foreseeable future. Placing emphasis on applications development, this unique resource offers a highly practical overview of GNSS (global navigation satellite systems), including GPS. The applications presented in the book range from the traditional location applications to combining GNSS with other sensors and systems and into more exotic areas, such as remote sensing and space weather monitoring. Written by leading experts in the field, this book presents the fundamental underpinnings of GNSS and provides you with detailed examples of various GNSS applications. Moreover, the software included with the book contains valuable processing tools and real GPS data sets to help you rapidly advance your own work in the field. You will find critical information and tools that help give you a head start to embark on future research and development projects. DVD Included! Contains valuable processing tools and data sets to complement many of the applications presented in the book. The software allows you to apply the details presented in the book and expand and enhance the provided code examples to suit your individual applications.},

  abstract = {``GNSS - GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and more'' is the extension of the scientific bestseller ``GPS - Theory and Practice'' to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and includes the Russian GLONASS, the European system Galileo, and additional systems.  The book refers to GNSS in the generic sense to describe the various existing reference systems for coordinates and time, the satellite orbits, the satellite signals, observables, mathematical models for positioning, data processing, and data transformation.  With respect to the individual systems GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and more, primarily the specific reference systems, services, the space and the control segment, as well as satellite signals are described. Furthermore, augmentations by space- and ground-based systems are discussed.  This book is a university-level introductory textbook and is intended to serve as a reference for students as well as for professionals and scientists in the fields of geodesy, surveying engineering, navigation, and related disciplines.},
